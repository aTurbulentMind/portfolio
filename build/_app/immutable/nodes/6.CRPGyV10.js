		website</p> <li>Design</li> <p>The color, layout, and design of your website will be created after deep consideration to how
		you want to be expressed.</p> <li>Development</li> <p>This is the phase of building your website from nothing. We want everything to be as you want
		it.</p> <li>Testing</li> <p>This is where we will begin to test across different screens, platforms and browsers to make
		sure everything is crisp, pixel perfect and as bug free as possible.</p> <li>Deployment</li> <p>This is where DR Frankenstein screams about the creation coming to life. Your site will become a
		living thing at this point.</p> <li>Support</li> <p>Support will continue for free for the first year for anything that comes up that we did not
		think of. Not sure it would be possible to think of everything at once. Amazon did not become
		the giant it is without fine tuning</p> <li>Management</li> <p>We can take it a step further than simple and start tracking and managing data to get an even
		deeper connection to those who find their way to your space.</p></ul>`,1);function K(c){var p=E();C(G=>{R.title="Service page"});var r=A(p);t(r),a(r);var v=e(e(r,!0)),o=e(e(v,!0)),i=t(o),d=t(i);e(e(d,!0)),a(i);var n=e(e(i,!0)),g=t(n);e(e(g,!0)),a(n);var s=e(e(n,!0)),m=t(s);e(e(m,!0)),a(s);var l=e(e(s,!0)),w=t(l),y=e(e(w,!0));e(e(y,!0)),a(l);var u=e(e(l,!0)),b=t(u),_=e(e(b,!0));e(e(_,!0)),a(u);var h=e(e(u,!0)),k=t(h),x=e(e(k,!0));e(e(x,!0)),a(h),a(o);var T=e(e(o,!0)),f=e(e(T,!0)),$=t(f),S=e(e($,!0)),B=e(e(S,!0)),D=e(e(B,!0)),W=e(e(D,!0)),Y=e(e(W,!0)),j=e(e(Y,!0)),q=e(e(j,!0)),I=e(e(q,!0)),z=e(e(I,!0)),F=e(e(z,!0)),M=e(e(F,!0)),P=e(e(M,!0));e(e(P,!0)),a(f),L(c,p)}export{K as component};
