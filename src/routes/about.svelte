    <p>I am a thirty-two year old from western Washington. My family has been in the area for a few generations by now. With a new branch of the family tree under me carried by my two little best friends. The area and community of Washington make it easy to live here and never leave. Travel is fun but home is on the waters of the Puget Sound.</p>

    <p>I picked up website development a few years ago. I have done it for fun, but I want to use my skills to help people who need it. With great power comes great responsibility? While working in a retail store, I spent down time learning about building a new website for the shop. Something magic happened and I easily found myself addicted. One realm of learning bled into another. As the wealth of knowledge grew, so did the intrest in more.</p>

    <p>Today I find myself entranced by how I can help whoever I can with what makes me so happy. Not only does it benefit the recipient, but I get to become that much better along the way.</p>

    <p>I do spend some time with fun things like hiking and backpacking to get away and reset the brain from being immersed in technology. There is something magic about the serenity that is the nature of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

    <img src="img/nature1.jpg/" alt="a sunny day on top of a mountain at a lake. It is serene">

    <p>Or to unwind I may be caught spinning fire. As the world surrounding me slows at the crackling flint stored in the bic. The rush of endorfins pumping through the veins to the endpoints of each extremity. Within microseconds, the combustion seranades my soul with zen. The most prominent feeling of "this is peace" that I can access without a four hour trek.</p>
