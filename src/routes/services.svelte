	<p>
		The price of product varies between the scope of the project. I'm an economic human and always

    <img src="img/UI.png/" alt="">
	<p>
		The user interface is how the human interacts with a computer, website, enviroment or
		application. A well designed UI provides the user an experience that is easy and natural, in
		turn causing the user to question what they have been missing until now. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

    <img src="img/UX.png/" alt="">
	<p>
		UX is derived from the entire experience of the time spent at your site. How the culture around
		you or your product feels, and how it aligns with the material in front of them. "UX is
		concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of
		branding, design, usability and function." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

		The process of graphic design is the interconnected bridge between the art and means of
