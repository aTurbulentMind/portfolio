		<h3>West Sound RD (Full stack)</h3>
		<p>
			My partner asked if I could print up some name cards for her roller derby match. I had not
			made anything to be printed from the web. After messing around I figured the data for the team
			would be a great chance to connect a database to a website. The project ended up being able to
			print a selected list as name cards, it has a login system, a user level system to keep some
			people out of some places, profile info for players, warehouse management and has image
			storage for profiles or products.

			at learning how to display fetched data.
