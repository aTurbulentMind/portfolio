		I am a thirty-two year old from western Washington. My family has been in the area for a few
		generations by now. With a new branch of the family tree under me carried by my two little best
		friends. The area and community of Washington make it easy to live here and never leave. Travel
		is fun but home is on the waters of the Puget Sound.
	</p>

	<p>
		I picked up website development a few years ago. I have done it for fun, but I want to use my
		skills to help people who need it. With great power comes great responsibility? While working in
		a retail store, I spent down time learning about building a new website for the shop. Something
		magic happened and I easily found myself addicted. One realm of learning bled into another. As
		the wealth of knowledge grew, so did the intrest in more.

	<p>
		Today I find myself entranced by how I can help whoever I can with what makes me so happy. Not
		only does it benefit the recipient, but I get to become that much better along the way.
	</p>

	<p>
		I do spend some time with fun things like hiking and backpacking to get away and reset the brain
		from being immersed in technology. There is something magic about the serenity that is the
		nature of the Pacific Northwest.

	<p>
		Or to unwind I may be caught spinning fire. As the world surrounding me slows at the crackling
		flint stored in the bic. The rush of endorfins pumping through the veins to the endpoints of
		each extremity. Within microseconds, the combustion seranades my soul with zen. The most
		prominent feeling of "this is peace" that I can access without a four hour trek.
