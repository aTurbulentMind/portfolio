		I am a thirty-three year old from Western Washington.The area and community of Washington make
		it easy to live here and never leave. Travel is fun but home is on the waters of the Puget
		Sound.

		I picked up website development a few years ago. While working in a retail store. I spent down
		time learning about building a new website for the shop. Something magic happened and I easily
		found myself addicted. One realm of learning bled into another. As the wealth of knowledge grew,
		so did the interest in learning more. I've done it for fun, but I want to use my skills to help
		people who need it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now I am deep into building 3d websites. Currently working on a new 3d portfolio page. It is so
		much fun. And if a giant company succeeds in adoption of their mixed reality headsets, we will
		need spatial worlds to explore beyond our old flat places of simple scrolling.
	</p>

	<p>
		I do spend some time with fun things like going to concerts or playing video games. To get away
		and reset the brain. Hiking and backpacking is another nice escape from being immersed in
		technology. There is something magic living in the wild serenity of the Pacific Northwest.
