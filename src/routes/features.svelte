The contact screens provide instant access to information on the debtor, multiple accounts, payments, payment plans, contact notes, post dated checks, notice history, etc. The contact notes are unlimited in size.

Besides the standard notice variable, you can calculate data and create your own variables, you can chain notices into a series and have multiple dunning notice series as well. Design one dunning series to accommodate medical collections and another for commercial or retail collections. As accounts are processed through the dunning series, you can automatically turn them over to a collector for a call. The dunning series can update the status, priority or collector assigned to the account. They can interrupt the notification sequence, restart, or redirect it at their discretion. Collectors can even print quick notices without interrupting the processing of the dunning series. Debt$Net® can also export notices to outsource companies.</p>
