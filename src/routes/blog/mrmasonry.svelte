        Yay! New project time. It is something I started already. I should probably work on more than one thing. Unless I can figure out if I can remote to my pc and make blender renders. The current build needs a photo gallery. And I need her to collect some client testimonials. Maybe I could figure out a comment system so people can leave a rating for her service on her page. That would be a cool addition. I am also going to make a few different logos to give her one to pick from. I guess that gives me a few things to work on that don't require 3d build time.

    Of all things, I need as fuck to put up some signs and make a few ads. Or at least one. And then another and kinda learn what works advertising-wise. Making a couple would be beneficial and sharing them with friends to see what they think. Do some inner testing. I need to reach out to google for a new code to activate my business account. I should probably set up my whiteboard at home. That way I can have an analog cloud checklist of goals. It feels real to see it in my face on ink.

    If you build a website, do you just jump in and go for it? Or do you look at other pages for reference? I used to just doodle up a page and make it. After pages kept looking bad I started to learn about design. I think that may have been one of those ah-ha moments when I fell more in love with front-end development. There are so many cool websites. Enough design searches and now some things really kind of irk me. They shouldn't but they do. Especially visibility. I gave a good amount of my day looking at photography and countertop websites. Searching out what a great image gallery looks like to the niche of the market. To me, countertop sites either have no gallery or it sucks.

    This is why I can't let myself feed into imposter syndrome. I comb through all these sites and can build better cooler stuff. A few may look good but are missing vital things that would make them cool. Almost all of them are big companies. Being a small local place will help her. It will probably keep her clients local. I only found one page that had anything seemingly new or innovative. There was an option to share a picture and check the looks of their product in your kitchen. That is cool. But it was just a still shot manipulation.

    I pretended to work on a side-scroll action today. I spent most of the time trying to fiddle with and refactor a horizontal scroll I had already used. After so many hours I looked around. There has to be a better way. There has to be something. And the University of Youtube had an answer that was quite suitable. There was a cool grid setup for horizontal scrolling that allows touch and the page can still keep its native vertical scroll. That will allow multiple galleries within one page. So the showroom could have a list that is micro galleries as their button. Technology is so cool. Being able to speak computer is pretty great. It makes me want to pick up another language.

    The debt page drags me back into more hours of little scoping. It is a great lesson in dealing with a client. Asking for something simple. Then when simple gets delivered it's " hey can it do this or that? Can you make it pop?" Laughing crying emoji. I guess it probably only took me three hours of actual work today. And I am learning something in that time. I am feeling the wear and tear of the week. Next week is a four-day weekend. And I need a four-day weekend. This 5 days a week at a job I donâ€™t want is taxing. Maybe I expect too much out of wanting happiness at work? It kind of feels like that.

    Is that a glaring difference between now and the days of my past? Was that voice of hope that much harder to argue? Was my youthful voice that much more powerful against the darkness? Or is that just my view through some funny-shaped glasses.
