	<h1>Final note</h1>

	<p>
		Fine tuning and practice makes better. The idea of perfect is ridiculous. Nobody should seek to
		achieve a level of perfection. That is a deep cut I wish I would have taken account for years
		ago. There is no perfect developer, there is no perfect website and people will always have an
		opinion about what is and is not good. On the drive in to work today I was thinking of where my
		agency and page could be if I had just leapt into the unknown. I have made a few of my own
		pages. Starting from the ground up each time. Thinking it would be some type of way better then
		just progressing so slowly.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent yesterday cleaning up SVG on the tattoo page and getting my own page all well rounded.
		Every day I am having a harder and harder time keeping fueled with motivation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I need some wins in my life. I need some kind of leeway. This sick feeling never really goes
		away anymore. It is just a waiting period to the next bout of battling with myself. It gets
		heavy and I'm getting tired of lifting this weight. I don’t want it anymore. I see no other
		option. I see no other way for me to get out. I don't think I want to blog anymore. I am not
		receiving any mental gratification. Its just another thing to spend time on that I lose interest
		in. I would pay to care by now. If it would make me a bit more happy. I wouldn’t lose a wink of
		sleep the cost. Ha. I know that’s a lie because I'm so economic.
	</p>
	<p>I'm tired.</p>
	<p>
		I want to participate in society. I want to have friends and circles of people across the
		different social platforms. Don’t be like me. I open an app, with full knowledge of how it
		impacts us as a species. I know these companies feed bullshit to the people. I know they collect
		and sell our data and information while they build a dossier on how to sell you things before
		you know you want it. I am not in favor of the great algorithm gods. I don’t do trendy shit. So
		anything I do share is invisible to the world. Unless I pay to boost it through the scroll.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each platform has its own reason to not like it. So I shut away. The options are not hard to
		measure out on the scale. They make me feel sick so I tend to stay away. I reach out to people I
		have called friend over time to only catch silence. So I stopped bothering people. Which makes
		me nauseas. Is it not the algorithm? Is it actually me that is the problem? If people unaffected
		by the algorithm don’t want to talk to me, it has to be me. So if I don’t want to be alive and
		the world does not care for me to exist why am I here? I feel like a waste of societies
		resources. I say I'm here for my kids, but how much better would their life be without me. How
		much trauma would be saved from my lack of parenting skills. Instead of hope in their father
		they would have nothing to let them down. Its getting harder to hang on to this cliff.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted to be here for them for years. I held on to the hope that I could do something to make
		their life and future better. I lost control of that idea a few weeks ago. I don’t see hope in
		my future. I see pain. I see suffering that wont change. If I look back through the thirty some
		years I've been here already, how do I find any hope that the suffering will be any different
		over the next thirty. Poverty and lacking the self love to care about existing. Living and not
		being able to take the steps I know I need is a daily prison. I lock myself away in a shell that
		moves in the motive of how people expect me to be. There are real world depictions of great
		parents, I'll never be that.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don’t live for me. I don’t want to live. I am just pretending too. I am here so a few people
		will not go through the pain of me removing myself from our population. Is that any reason to
		take a breath? I don’t think so. I want to want to wake up. I want to desire the things of life,
		but they only make me nauseas. A few hits of serotonin between the troubling times made
		everything worth it. Now I feel grateful to the night for giving me the closest taste of death
		in letting sleep take me. I miss loving to wake up to have a chance at another day.
	</p>
	<p>
		I disservice my partner by depriving memories that could have been the best of her life. I lose
		my sense of having fun and find it so difficult to be in the moment which robs us of happy
		memories. She could have such a better life without me holding her down, she claims otherwise. I
		think to all of the times when I was trash as a person. I do not always act the best. She
		deserves better than I could ever be.
	</p>
	<p>
		I cant apply myself and I am dying because of it. I have spent four years learning different
		things about web development and still don’t make much more than minimum wage. More proof that
		society deems me unworthy of life. Our local cost of living is more than $12 an hour higher then
		I make. All because I cant take action on the things I've learned. Its my fault that I am not
		any further. So why would I try? Do I spend four more years of minimum wage jobs while people in
		six months make five times my wages?
	</p>
	<p>
		I know what it takes to get my life right. I have a list of things that would improve my
		everyday. I have zero energy or actual motivation to make them happen. Why? Why cant I do what
		it takes to make my life better? Is it that I don’t deserve it and know it. Using development as
		a bottomless pit to throw my consciousness into? Are all of these activities to keep me away
		from enjoying my last day?
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm not good. And I don’t feel like I will get better. I've had periods where there was a bounce
		back. A return to motivation. I don’t know that I will find it again. I don’t see much point in
		trying or pretending to want to. I don’t have anyone I can talk to really. And what would change
		if I did. What would become different? People would think even less of me. They would look with
		a pointing finger claiming me a loser. If the shoe fits. I have not done shit with my life to
		argue their point. In fact I leaned in to being worthless. I just don’t have the energy for
		trying anymore. Just running on autopilot so I don’t have time to pick up however I choose to go
		out.
