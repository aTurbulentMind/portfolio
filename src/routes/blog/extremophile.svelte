		You must live to fight another day. We are told that and some of us have this unquenchable need
		to believe it ourselves. Do you drink from that fountain? Is it common for you to easily find
		your fill? Or is the place they find contentment, for you some void of emptiness devouring every
		other idea or emotion? You have to answer that for yourself. I'm looking to uncover a few stones
		in my pile of questions. As in "why care about people around, when you are always alone inside
		of your head"? Is there any reason I should feel like I am missing out on human interaction? I
		can feel alone in a crowd of people, I don’t need to have the door closed of a solo studio
		apartment to feel disconnected from the world around me. "Why do I expect anything out of anyone
		including myself"? If expectations live to die without respect then why give them a chance to
		live at all? Is that a killer of hope? "Do I even want to see another day"?

		Life is clinging on where it seems it should not exist like some kind of extremophile. My very
		being is nuclear and the chance I am here is just so strange. The fact that any of us exist is
		strange. Floating on a rock around a star in the infinite ocean of space. Billions of years to
		get to here. A crazy amount of stars and planets all with no signs of life except us. Everyone
		before us without the opportunity we have now. Luck is what allows your lungs to take air and
		break it down into the pumping veins through each extremity. Every single person alive won
		against odds of more than 1,000,000,000,000:1. These things alone should graciously grant some
		modicum amount of centeredness. That exact path is what I would have traveled to climb out of a
		spiral in the past. Today even these lines of thought can craft a kite to fly out of an
		encompassing darkness.

		You don’t have to be happy every single day. To be repetitive, fuck those expectations. Humans
		are not meant to be happy all the time. How lack luster would your shades become if everything
		happened how you want without any effort? How lung until you resented the refresh of oxygen. The
		rebound and how long I stay out of that spiral is a big question that keeps pushing out all the
		other thought bubbles. This is quickly turning from place for me to talk about the growth of
		myself through web development into an expose of complaints and ranting. If I cant get away from
		this vibe I am not sure I can continue. It will only end up a detriment to my life and future.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fuck do I really care about "the future". I don’t give a fuck about breathing this very
		moment. Why would I care about then. Self fucking sabotage. Letting down anyone that ever told
		me I could be great. Letting down all the time I spent trying anything in the past. There's that
		sick feeling.

		I ordered a new tool for work. A drawing tablet. And talk about increasing the quality of life.
		I love when I can find something that drastically improves my life or time management. Prime
		example, I love to throw a cut potato into the air fryer to make some homemade fries. The most
		painstaking action with that is cutting the spuds. So I got a fry cutter. Turns twelve minutes
		into two. That makes my life so much better. So getting this tablet has been such an improvement
		to the vibe. It's funny to me how a little thing like that will boost my morale and interest
		toward a goal.

		After downloading the driver and software for the tablet I set up my button mapping. I had to
		mess around a bit and ended up changing the zoom in button in gimp to get it to be my workflow.
		The first couple hours took some getting used to. The connect between pad to screen was strange
		at first, but it became fluid before long. It is so fun to draw with a pen and have it proper to
		the screen. In the past I have used stylus to do art or doodle and whatnot. Nothing like this
		pen and tablet. It kind of feels like writing on actual paper. It has this matte almost rough
		feeling. I like it.

		My first couple creations are some SVG images for the friends site. And that is so cool. That
		makes me want to go back and make custom SVG for everything. Gotta get my own site custom. Have
		to set up Laurie and the tattoo place. That is one of those fields that pushed me to focus on
		frontend. Those aesthetic matter to me. I seen a few videos on selling SVG. That would be really
		cool as some passive income. It makes me want to draw on someone's face. I love grimed out art
		and it has been a really long time since I worked on. Like I said. Things like this can totally
		flip some level of motivation. I feel it calling me to it. I've got to go.
