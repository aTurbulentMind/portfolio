		Getting lost in nature can be that ever so necessary keg stand of levelheadedness you're
		questing for. It’s a low cost joy quenching activity. There is no tech for me in the middle of
		nowhere. Well, let me be clear, no music, no social media, or podcasts or anything like that.
		I'm not trying to go full bushmaster. I don’t give a fuck if nowhere is in the middle of town.
		Surround me in trees, maybe line one side with shore and I am where I need to be. The kids will
		be a great addition to those real vista points. I forget how important it is. How refueling it
		is. My heart goes out to the people confined in the concrete jungle, the horizon is the closest
		to a tree they get.

		Let's cut into the week's work. Not a whole lot of learning. I have been processing Con's site.
		I have done enough by now that a lot of my process is in my mental library. If anything it's
		finding what works. A prime example is for merch on this page I'm working on, I wanted to have a
		background image as a shirt and a variable inside that can be whatever image file that would be
		on the shirt. The image overlay kept fighting me so I just made a tiny png that act as a button.
		It does the thing I ask it so I will take it. Now, most of the list is checked off. I would like
		to make a background in blender. Some drops of blood on the concrete surface would be great. And
		maybe add a loading screen for whenever the site is taking more than three seconds.
	</p>

		That would be something worth the time to do. I try to at least learn a few things. This page
		was definitely making SVG. That shit is so much fun. Now I just want to doodle and work on
		design stuff all day. That frontend dev life.

		It is starting to finally feel like summer around here. After the solstice we had our first day
		over 70 degrees. We spend so many of our days under this overcast blanket grey. Day in and day
		out. Just grey. It's oppressing. It can be easy to blend lines between my own inner turmoil and
		the effect of the weather. That lack of vitamins from the sun is a killer. We have a backpacking
		trip planned for the weekend. More of that outdoor reset we need so much. To a place in Eastern
		Washington near Quincy called Ancient Lakes.

		This week I have really attempted to put my mental space first. No thoughts of work shit while I
		am not working. At least a few weeks to heal a bit from these damned burns to that squishy bit
		of brain matter between your ears. For a long time I have thought my incessant need to be busy
		all the time was a personal issue. Some error in my head from my actual mother being sedentary.
		Over the last few weeks I have heard a few people mention their own need to be active at all
		moments in the day. What a relief. Other people are going through the same problem. We know we
		need to stop and have a moment but we feel that need to always be on. We in that category have
		to learn to set boundaries at where we are comfortable. We deserve that much at least.

		At the end of the week I sent out a social media life update. It was refreshing to see people
		care a little bit. I even had a few friends reach out to me about their own interest or path to
		web development. I love that. One of them is into music and wants to build a site for their
		clothing and music. I love that because I started in that similar space. Wanting to make my own
		product and having absolute control over the workings of it. We talked about writing code
		together and that is great. I love the idea of working on something together with people. I love
		the idea of making a great team of people all interested in growing mentally and financially
		while helping people. It should help by finding people who came from nothing like myself. There
		is often an itch in the back of our character to help lift others from the trauma we faced for
		years or decades of our life.

		Another to reach out has been a friend since Jr High. She has always been a super supportive
		human around me and if I could, I want her on my team. She is super compassionate about animals
		and came from a broken childhood like mine. I already know her to work with the Boy's and Girl's
		group so know she has a kind heart. That matters. People that care about others are frequently
		put at a lower rung for giving so much of themselves to the world. This world has no hesitation
		to take everything it can and leave a shell of who you always wanted to be. We must refuse the
		relinquishment of what we hold so close in the progression of our life.
	</p>
	<p>
		The trip was great and I'll be writing about how life feels after the staycation we had. Tanks
		are refilled and ready to be busy and productive.
