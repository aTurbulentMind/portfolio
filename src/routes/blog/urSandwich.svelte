        Reprogram your brain. That feels like a word that I have looked at for too long. You know, when it does not seem like it should. Almost like you are sure that this is not how it is spelled. I listened to a podcast over the weekend that has fogged my mind from seeing anything beyond it. Everything I do or think or the things I see, all lead back to the same place. Like I am lost on a looping path. Are you on autopilot? What the fuck kind of question is that? No, I am living and doing things. I exist. How about when you drive somewhere? It helps when you know where to go, say your job. After enough drives back and forth, do you think about it? Or do you travel away inside to think and process your day, past, future, or any other idea? When you are adventuring in your mind how much attention around you are you paying? Your body knows how to drive. Is there much about it you need to think about?

   We can insert any activity you do without thinking. Some of them are inherited from your makers. You picked it up while you learned to walk and talk. Subtle actions and evident, none escape.  As with your parent's habits, some you do not intentionally adhere to. Those can be harder to change. Other programs are not natural. You learn them. Such as playing basketball or driving. Chemical actions like smoking or prescriptions can be increasingly difficult to shift from. No matter what you have picked up to quote the CIA "any animal can be trained to do anything within its physical capabilities". That means you can learn or unlearn what you want. Yeah, you will face some difficulties. We all do as humans. Some are going to deal with a heavier pushback than others.

   You still can. You have to teach yourself that you can. It will often start with some classic self-affirmation. Followed by action to display that change of thought. Rinse and repeat every single day until you no longer have to think about it. Like how we reference habits. Coding is a process of learning. You have to try and try and do things different and mix it up. You have to break things to learn. That way you no longer have to think as much. Keep trying. It is not easy. A better life won't be. I lean on a personal affirmation that "if it is easy, it's probably not worthy".

  Time for a random topic change, I have to rant a bit about chicken sandwiches. I fucking love chicken sandwiches. I really don’t eat fast food. I can make almost everything, but better. So why pay overprice? And I know how cheap that can sound. But I have always been an economic person. Growing up without much taught me that way. Just like with a website. I built the first one because I did not want to pay someone for the product. Maybe when my life is less economic. Right now, I cant justify things that are only ok. A chicken sandwich though. The only war I have ever loved and supported entirely. I don’t support those scumbags at chik-fill-a. I wasn’t always the best human. That’s part of being human. Learning from where we come from and becoming better every day. But to hate people over sexual preference in 2022 is some stupid shit.

 So Popeye's starts. And what a start. What a great way to set the bar. Well seasoned dredge (that’s the crispy outside), soft delicious bun, pickles (extra for me please), and mayo. Not even six dollars. When it came out it was barely four. Fire. I am not surprised that they would pick up the crown. I go back for this sandwich frequently.

    Next up came the great people at KFC. And they came out swinging. That wonderful secret blend of herbs and spices stands tall in this entry. The bun is just regular. That lowers its score a bit. And I am surprised. The pickles are good. Like with anywhere I get. I need the pickles. The chicken is a pretty good size. And it's not dry which is a win. Dry white meat chicken is the worst. I will skip that part of a plate. I like this sandwich and have gotten more than one, but it does not match Popeye's entry. 
        </p>
        <p>I could not find a picture to acuretly present what Jack-in-the-box produced. yeah they have their commercial photos, but they are so far from what you actually get that its not the same thing.</p>
        <p>
    Then we get Jack-in-the-box. If you got here you know I am economic. The Popeye and KFC sandwich was still $3.99. Jack wants to charge $8 for just the sandwich. Really? Do you think you are twice as good as Popeye's? I don't want to spend that on this, but I guess I have to. Looking at the rest of their menu and most meals start around $12. Yo, why the fuck do you think you can change that? You don’t pay people more than 15 an hour. And you are not a real restaurant. What makes you think you can charge such a high price for the lowest quality food? Whatever. Sell me the chicken. The most expensive chicken bread combo better be good. For the cost of a four-pack of chicken thighs, I got disappointment. Anger. The chicken was bland and dry. The bread was a regular bun. My extra pickles were four altogether. Yeah, I have nothing good to say about Jack. More reason to not go to that place.

    Bk. What you got? A Ch'king. Ok. Call it whatever you like, I will call it how it tastes. They have a good bun. Ok. Let's start well at least. The dredge is crunchy. Extra crunchy. And there is not any extra seasoning. Maybe a bit of salt and pepper. It would be great for kids and people who don’t like a lot of seasonings. Hey, some folks are sensitive to some things. The pickles are thick and they hooked it up. Thank you for that. And they respect the sauce. KFC can kinda overload the sauce a bit. But BK hit it right. If the KFC sandwich was still as big as the Popeye's or BK was it would rank higher. The Bk variety is a great option.

    Panera just threw a contestant in the ring. The problem I have with it, the fucking sandwich by itself is $12. I got a big middle finger for that. That shit is almost funny to me. A chicken sandwich is worth almost as much to them as an hour of someone's life. Lol. Gtfoh. And taco bell tried with this gross chicken tender thing. It was like $3 for a half inch wide three inch long chicken thing on flatbread. They got crucified over it.

    I am saving my least favorite for last. McDonalds makes the worst of all of them. It was six dollars by itself. The chicken was about the size of a mcchicken and had no sauce. On top of that the thing looked like it had been fried three times before it got to me. It tasted like a chicken nugget. And the pickles were dry. how does that happen? dry pickles are so strange. I was pretty pissed. I wanted to be mad at the employee for what I got. But lets be real. I just cant be mad at the people anymore. I have worked where the employer cares about their staff. Those people care about work and what they do. The product shows. Fuck these corporations. They just take and take and take. Devaluing the worth of humans. All for their profit over people approach.

    There are more to try still. So I may have to revisit this in the future. But I love sandwichs so I thought I may rant about them for a bit. Next week may be a bit of a story also. I finally got my replacement controllers from meta after two months and then some. Until then. I love you. Enjoy your week.
