        Worked my way through the weeds. Made the lists look pretty. Now it's time to go back and set up proper measurements and sizes. Make sure it all looks good. While hitting any items on the checklist made by the previewer. I am sure there will be stuff here and there. There always is. It is to the furthest point it's ever been and getting pretty close to finished. Gonna do a little bit of styling to make sure everything is all crisp like some fresh funnel cake.

   I refactored some pages. Got rid of extra code that was doubled up or dead removed. I tried to make a specific sass file to handle responsiveness. The site would not read from the component file that I had been using for my styles. Maybe I could just link right to the component page. That will be the next thing to attempt. I am trying to write at the end of every day and piece it together at the end of the week. It should be a bit easier to mind the day-to-day. I have just not been super inspired to write the last two days. Not sure why. Maybe promoting these words will inspire me a bit. I need to put up signs and find a gig. I have to become self-sufficient. Having to show up at a job is not so great for me.

   I wish that it was not that way. I want to be excited or at least interested in my day-to-day. I want to feel about work the way making 3d models makes me feel. I think finishing up this pancake debt site will be a boost. I have not worked on much else lately. It would probably be good to go check in on the tattoo shop. That is another site I could finish. Neither are paid gigs, but the complete on my record could help.

   I heard a developer on a podcast talk about being into dev since 2016. I have been in since 2018. Damn. Why am I not working in the industry? I should have started looking two years ago. Then I remember looking a year ago. Fuck! Maybe I could just pay someone to apply for jobs for me. I don’t want to see them. It is demoralizing. Maybe if I could find someone to mentor. When the homegirl Bea showed a bit of interest that was a huge boost. And I need something like that. I need something.

    By Wednesday I should be making the countertop a bit shinier. I am excited a lot about that page because it will be the first of any 3d enhanced sites that I have made. I am can't wait to build out a kitchen or two in a VR space and be able to go into it.
    Something about making worlds and getting to visit them as they are being made gets me so hyped about learning more or moving forward. Pancake sites are cool, and it's nice to be able to make them. A good amount of the excitement I feel comes from the next step. Some analysts are projecting a 13 trillion dollar market by 2030. With a mufuckin T. I want in on a bit of those profit. I've always had a whole lot of nothing. So even just a little bit would be a reprieve. 
    </p>
    <p>
  It seems super fun also. Each attempt or tutorial makes me go a bit crazy with excitement. We could make VR stores or product design pages. Giving something that chance to break out of two dimensions. It adds an entirely new world. It will take rethinking to make sites great. All of the objects in a site get to be made in-house. We get a new level of creativity.

  I don’t always want to. Sometimes it's only a day or so. But I don’t want to do anything. It can start as a sentence. I've gotten to the point I can single it out as it happens. I can try to dispel the thought. I can argue the rationality of it. Yet I throw it in the crockpot to marinate and stew through the day. When I was younger it would last more than a week. Now it may last a few days. Most often it's gone the next day. Even on the days, I don’t want to breathe I still push myself to do something. 
    </p>
    <p>
  Even if it is just to not think about whatever it is. The vibe has a common creator. Finances, location, time, people, or what I expected out of me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. That feeling that you are about to puke just kind of hangs out at the top of your stomach. I try to think my way out of this and end up worse. It makes me want to escape reality. Whether jumping into a video game or turning on the tv and melting. I am getting quite lost in sci-fi podcasts. Anything to get my mind away from the world. 
    </p>
    <p>
  That’s not the healthy answer though. Hiding gets me nowhere fast. It won't progress me or help me to not do anything. I tell myself the troupe "I'll get to that tomorrow". How much further could I be if I tried. I have made music for years and nothing. I am not even a little bit good. Is that my path for web development? Am I destined to continue what I have always been? Nothing. What's the fucking point? Why fucking try if I can't do anything with what I pretend to learn? What's the point…There is the sick feeling.

  Then it's gone. Kind of still taste like an annoyance in my mouth. It just lingers like a nasty hangover. You can't shake it. Food or drink milds the symptoms, but time is the only thing that can help you feel better. Some people would seek mental health assistance. I have told myself that I would rather feel something. That to emote is to live. That there is some pendulum of emotion wired into us that when we rise, we will then fall. If you panic at the sight of that fall any other in the future will be that much more difficult. If it's true or just me reasoning away my like of money for a mental health advisor of any sort, I am not sure.

  I worked my way through the debt site. I opened the next folder. It is a fancy countertop site. I need to make some renders for 3d objects for the site. And it needs an image gallery. The latter will be the easy part. The current list of things I plan to make as 3d models is a slice of pizza, then for leafy will be the logo and a couple of countertops. Add the counters on rotating in the background. And like aforementioned I'm going to make two example rooms to check out in XR.

 There was a bit of housecleaning to be done. And I was just looking a bit. Fixed a set of expanding cards on the intro page. It was nice just to look at something else. I am going to have to refactor for large screens. I don’t code on anything 4k. And it has a surprising difference in how things look. So I may have to make my vs code account connect to the cloud. That way I can open my project on my work screen. That would also allow me to work seamlessly between laptop, desktop, and work computer. That makes me wonder if I could remote to my home pc to make 3d models while I am at work… oh shit son. How did I not think of that before? I have to see if I can set it up. I could essentially set up my pc and RDC to my laptop.
